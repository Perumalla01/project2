Francisco Roman: Some of my strengths have been on an understanding on Javascript. A current course in Rich Internet Applications is slowly instilling more Java Script syntax and animation through CSS and JavaScript.

My strengths are UI/UX design, and writting decent HTML. Also can help a bit in JavaScript. Looking forward to working with you all. Mainly CSS and HTML are my strengths.
